            <h2>About me.</h2>
            <p>In the last years we are witnessing to a major revolution in the technological world, a revolution that opens up new business opportunities by
              extending the usage of high-tech products not only to tech lovers and to the experts, but also to all those people who before were completely far
              from it. The dominant factors of this revolution are the user experience and the design (look &amp; feel) of the new products. Whereas before a
              device or an application was designed and developed essentially to fulfill certain tasks, today the aesthetic has become a crucial point through
              which a product decides its market price and its number of users who will buy it.</p>
            <p>Since I was a child I always loved to express myself through two major art forms: music and drawing. What fascinated me was the power of these
              media in creating different moods through a song or through a simple picture. Applying such qualities to technological products causes an
              improvement in the perceived quality of the product itself, turning it in an object of pleasure.</p>
            <p>Said that, bring together creativity, design, and efficient solutions to delight people with amazing creations in this new technology era is my
              mission.</p>
            <p>A bit about my background, I have a master&rsquo;s degree with honours in Computer Engineering, which took me around 6 years to complete. I
              graduated in Rome at Universit&agrave; degli Studi di Roma &ldquo;Tor Vergata&rdquo;. Always in Rome, I made my first internship at IBM &ndash; Rome
              Smart Solutions Lab, with which I improved my technical skills in the development of mobile business applications and web applications. There I had
              the opportunity to work on real big critical projects understanding the approaches to the different development processes in an enterprise context.</p>
            <p>
              In the meanwhile, after that my internship day was over, I worked on my own start-up (
              <a href="http://www.showon.it" target="_blank">www.showon.it</a>
              ) that has been launched as beta release three days before my graduation day. It is a vertical social network that has as main target the entire
              dance world. Currently counts more than 20k registered users between amateurs, professionals, and organizations related to the international dance
              world.
            </p>
            <p>
              After graduating, I spent nearly 6 months extrapolating a full paper from my thesis work that has been then accepted in the &ldquo;Fourth
              International Conference on Mobile Computing, Applications and Services&rdquo; MobiCASE 2012, Seattle and published in the correlated proceedings by
              Springer (
              <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-36632-1_4" target="_blank">Mobile Apps Development: A Framework for Technology
                Decision Making</a>
              ).
            </p>
            <p>
              In July 2012, I moved from Rome to Germany and I started to work in the German public sector at
              <a href="http://www.fiz-karlsruhe.de/" target="_blank">FIZ Karlsruhe</a>
              (Fachinformationszentrum Karlsruhe) as Software Engineer/Certified Usability Analyst in the IT, Development &amp; Applied Research department. Here
              we are especially working on rich internet applications like: Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek (German Digital Library), Archive Portal D, and Thieme.
